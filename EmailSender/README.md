Project Name: Email Sender

Description:

This Python script facilitates the automated sending of confirmation emails for user signups. Utilizing the `smtplib` library and secure SSL connection, the script connects to Gmail's SMTP server. The email content, including the sender's address, recipient's address, subject, and body, is structured using the `EmailMessage` class from the `email.message` module.

The script is designed to be modular and secure, with sensitive information such as email credentials stored externally (in this case, `password` is imported from `appPass`). The email's content is easily customizable, making it suitable for various applications that require automated email confirmation.

The provided code ensures the correct setup for a Gmail SMTP server connection, sending a signup confirmation email with a predefined subject and body. This script can serve as a foundation for implementing email confirmation functionalities in web applications or other systems that require user authentication.
